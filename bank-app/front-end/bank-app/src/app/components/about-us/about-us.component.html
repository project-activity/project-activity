            The bank descends from the Bank of Calcutta, founded in 1806 via the Imperial Bank of India, making it the
            oldest commercial bank in the Indian Subcontinent. The Bank of Madras merged into the other two presidency
            banks in British India, the Bank of Calcutta and the Bank of Bombay, to form the Imperial Bank of India,
            which in turn became the State Bank of India in 1955.Overall the bank has been formed from the merger
            and acquisition of nearly twenty banks over the course of its 200 year history.The Government of
            India took control of the Imperial Bank of India in 1955, with Reserve Bank of India (India's central bank)
            taking a 60% stake, renaming it State Bank of India.
